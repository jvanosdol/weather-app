## Description

*** This project is still missing the ability to save and then display recent searches 

The purpose of the project is to create a weather app that displays current and future weather conditions for a user specified location.

The app is comprised of a 'search bar', a 'current weather' box, and a 'future weather' box. The search bar allows the user to enter in a specific location, once the 'search' button is clicked, the current and future weather are displayed in their respective boxes. 

This app durectly pulls data from the OpenWeatherAPI, this allows the user to gather relevant data for specific location. The weathe rdata that we are required to display in the current weather box are current temp, wind speed, humidity, UV index, and pressure.

In the future weather cards, we are required to display the future weather, wind speed, and high-low temp range for that day. Based on the predicted weather for a given day in the future, an icon representing the weather is to be displayed as well. (ie. if the weather is sunny two days out, a sun/sunny icon will be displayed)

I was unfortunately unable to display the past searches.
